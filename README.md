### medium 1 Visitor pattern
https://medium.com/@felipedutratine/visitor-design-pattern-in-golang-3c142a12945a

In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.
